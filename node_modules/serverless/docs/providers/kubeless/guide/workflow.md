# Kubeless - Workflow

Intro. Quick recommendations and tips for various processes.

### Development Workflow

1. Write your functions
2. Use `serverless deploy` only when you've made changes to `serverless.yml` and in CI/CD systems.
3. Use `serverless deploy function -f myFunction` to rapidly deploy changes when you are working on a specific Kubeless Function.
4. Use `serverless invoke -f myFunction -l` to test your Kubeless Functions.
5. Open up a separate tab in your console and stream logs in there via `serverless logs -f myFunction -t`.
6. Write tests to run locally.

### Larger Projects

- Break your application/project into multiple Serverless Services.
- Model your Serverless Services around Data Models or Workflows.
- Keep the Functions and Resources in your Serverless Services to a minimum.

## Cheat Sheet

A handy list of commands to use when developing with the Serverless Framework.

##### Create A Service:

Creates a new Service

```
serverless create -p [SERVICE NAME] -t kubeless-python
```

```
serverless create -p [SERVICE NAME] -t kubeless-nodejs
```

##### Deploy All

Use this when you have made changes to your Functions, Events or Resources in `serverless.yml` or you simply want to deploy all changes within your Service at the same time.

```
serverless deploy
```

##### Deploy Function

Use this to quickly overwrite your Kubeless Functions, allowing you to develop faster.

```
serverless deploy function -f [FUNCTION NAME]
```

##### Invoke Function

Invokes an Kubeless Function and returns logs.

```
serverless invoke function -f [FUNCTION NAME] -l
```

##### Streaming Logs

Open up a separate tab in your console and stream all logs for a specific Function using this command.

```
serverless logs -f [FUNCTION NAME]
```

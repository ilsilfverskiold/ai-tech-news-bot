# Serverless Framework Examples and Tutorials

## Serverless Framework Examples

The simplest way to get started with Serverless Framework is to create a project based on the **built-in templates**. To do so, run the `serverless` command and choose a template from the list:

```shell
serverless
```

You can also find more examples and templates in the [**Serverless Examples registry**](https://www.serverless.com/examples).

The examples registry is a collection of official examples, as well as examples contributed by the community. You can publish your examples by adding them to the [examples GitHub repository](https://github.com/serverless/examples).

# Serverless CI/CD Best Practices

Serverless Framework provides a lot of capabilities out of the box to help you manage and deploy
your services. As your teams grow and the number of services grow, it can be difficult to know
the best way to organize your services for scale.

To help you manage and deploy your services at scale, check out the
[Serverless CI/CD Workflow Guide](https://www.serverless.com/guide-ci-cd) for our recommendations
on organizing your apps, services, repos and automating your release process.

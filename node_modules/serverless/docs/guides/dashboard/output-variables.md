# Outputs

The Serverless Framework Dashboard helps you refactor large serverless applications by decoupling the shared services from the dependent services. The new outputs feature allows you to define output key/values in a `serverless.yml` and then reference those key/values in other `serverless.yml` files. The key/values are published to Serverless Framework Dashboard when you deploy, and they are loaded in other services when they are deployed.

## Define outputs for shared services

Define new outputs by adding a dictionary (key/value pairs) to the `outputs:` field in the `serverless.yml` file. The values can include any value supported by YAML, including strings, integers, lists (arrays), and dictionaries (key/value pairs). The dictionaries can also be nested to any depth.

**serverless.yml**

```yaml
outputs:
  my-key: my-value
  my-availability-zones:
    - us-east-1a
    - us-east-1b
  my-table-name: DynamoDbTable-${self:custom.stage}
```

The values will be interpolated and saved when the service is deployed. The values are saved as a part of the service instance so they are associated with the service, stage and region.

## Use outputs in dependent services

Outputs can be consumed from other services with they `${output}` variable. The reference must be formatted as `<service-id>.<key>`, where the `<service-id>` references another service in the same application, stage and region and the `<key>` references the dictionary key from the `outputs:`. The `<key>` can also be nested to reference nested values from the dictionary.

**serverless.yml**

```yaml
${output:my-service.var-key}
```

or, to reference a service in a different app, stage or region, specify it like this:

```yaml
${output:appname:stagename:regionname:my-service.var-key}
```

So, for example:

```yaml
${output:another-app:dev:us-east-1:my-service.var-key}
```

You can also omit any of app, stage or region by leaving it empty like this, which only specifies
stage:

```yaml
${output::dev::my-service.var-key}
```

## Use outputs from the command line

Outputs can also be accessed on the CLI. You can use this at development time to look up the outputs without opening the dashboard, or in your CI/CD pipeline to use the outputs in custom scripts.

### List outputs

```
sls output list
  [--org <org>]
  [--app <app>]
  [--service <service>]
  [--stage <stage>]
  [--region <region>]
```

If you are in a working directory with a `serverless.yml` then the outputs will be listed for the org, app, and service specified in the serverless.yml file.

If you are not in a working directory, without a `serverless.yml`, or if you want to access outputs from another org, app, service, or stage, you can pass in the optional flags.

### Get an output

```
sls output get
  --name <name>
  [--org <org>]
  [--app <app>]
  [--service <service>]
  [--stage <stage>]
  [--region region]
```

Individual outputs can also be accessed from the CLI using the `output get` sub-command. This command requires the `--name <name>` flag to identify the output name.

It is possible for the output value to be a json object, in which case, we recommend using a tool like [jq](https://stedolan.github.io/jq/) to parse the JSON.

Like the `sls output list` command, you can optionally specify a different org, app, service, stage or region using flags.

## View outputs in the dashboard

The outputs for a service are made available on two different pages of the Serverless Framework Dashboard.

The current outputs for a given service instance are available in the **OUTPUTS** section of the service instance view. This will show the key/values which are currently available.

The historic outputs for a given service instance are available as a part of the deployment record which is available in the **activity & insights** section of the service instance view after a deployment.
